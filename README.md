# Study Guide Webpage
## Description

This website was created to work as a study guide for the beginning of the Bootcamp.
Besides it's utility, the goal of this project was to get familiar with the process of version control in Git, as well as an introduction to the elements that will be used in future lessons.
This website allows you to see notes for each subject, and get a suggestion for what subject to study by opening chrome dev tools.
biggest learning win was everything that had to do with Git and GitHub. Being able to learn the proccess of commiting, pushing, and pulling to the main branch was very useful.

## Installation

No installation! Wow!

## Usage

Start by looking at the notes in general on the main page, and if you want some help choosing a topic to focus on, open the devtools using the 'inspect' option when you right click.
